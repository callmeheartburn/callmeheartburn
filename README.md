hi, call me heartburn. I love telling stories.

Trying to get better at it piece by piece/day by day - will post finished works here so I can look back and cringe in a couple years.

Days missed in my daily contribution plan: 1

28/09/23: Got wrapped up in work and didn't realise until 00:01 the next day (I'm furious about this btw, my beautiful streak....) \
07/10/23: forgor ðŸ’€ until 00:01... why is it always the minute after not before smh
12/10/23: lil bit of casual heartbreak, couldn't find the time. i'm really making a habit of this, god damn it
