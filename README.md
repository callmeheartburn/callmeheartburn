hi, call me heartburn. I love telling stories.

Trying to get better at it piece by piece/day by day - will post finished works here so I can look back and cringe in a couple years.

Days missed in my daily contribution plan: 3

28/09/23: Got wrapped up in work and didn't realise until 00:01 the next day (I'm furious about this btw, my beautiful streak....) \
07/10/23: forgor ðŸ’€ until 00:01... why is it always the minute after not before smh \
12/10/23: lil bit of casual heartbreak, couldn't find the time. i'm really making a habit of this, god damn it \
24/11/23: genuinely just forgot. i feel like this isn't so bad though life just gets busy yknow \
16/12/23: touched too much grass, need to work on that

(insert dates here) NYE is special, then took a week to recover from 'vacation'. was a slob, didn't like it. it's time to make some magic
